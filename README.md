# predicting-product-sale-through-advertisments
we determine whether a user on a social networking site wanted to buy a product after clicking on a commercial displayed on the website. This could be extremely advantageous for the company that sells the item.
The dataset includes user information from a social networking site, and by using that data as features in our machine learning model, we attempt to predict whether a specific user will really purchase a particular product after clicking on an ad there.
A automobile manufacturer, which was previously listed as a business client of this particular social networking site, advertises itself there by placing ads.
Here, the social network's task is to compile information on whether or not the consumer purchased the product. Purchased, the dependent variable in this scenario, is 1 if the user buys the car and 0 otherwise.
Therefore, the objective is to develop a classifier that will correctly classify each user by predicting whether or not he will purchase the goods.
